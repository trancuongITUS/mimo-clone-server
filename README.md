To-do list:
- Integrate environment variables.
- Find out how to make relationships between tables (user and course).
    - Side note: Find out the relationship between the user and the course first. Probably. Maybe. I don't know.
        - There should be an array property in the user that has the courses they are taking. And the course should have an array property that has the users taking the course.
        - Many-to-many relationship, perhaps?
- Create database tables (preferably as files for transferability).
- Stay healthy.
